Certificates: AWS Certificate to be attached to loadbalencer to expose the service over SSL.
TgCount: Target group count.
HealthyThresholdCount: The number of consecutive health checks successes required before considering an unhealthy target healthy.
UnHealthyThresholdCount: The number of consecutive health check failures required before considering a target unhealthy.
HealthCheckTimeoutSeconds: The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a failed health check.
HealthCheckIntervalSeconds: The approximate amount of time between health checks of an individual target.
HttpSuccessCode: The HTTP codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target. You can specify multiple values (for example, "200,202") or a range of values (for example, "200-299").
