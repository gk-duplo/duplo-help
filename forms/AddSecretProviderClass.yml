name: Secret Provider Class Name
provider: Secret Provider
parameters: |
  The parameters section contains the details of the mount request and contain one of the three fields:
  * objects: This is a string containing a YAML declaration (described below) of the secrets to be mounted.
      ```yaml
        objects:
        - objectName: "MySecret"
          objectType: "secretsmanager"
      ```
  The objects field of the SecretProviderClass can contain the following sub-fields:
  * objectName: This field is required. It specifies the name of the secret or parameter to be fetched. For Secrets Manager this is the [SecretId](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_GetSecretValue.html#API_GetSecretValue_RequestParameters) parameter and can be either the friendly name or full ARN of the secret. For SSM Parameter Store, this must be the [Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_GetParameter.html#API_GetParameter_RequestParameters) of the parameter and can not be a full ARN.
  * objectType: This field is optional when using a Secrets Manager ARN for objectName, otherwise it is required. This field can be either "secretsmanager" or "ssmparameter".
  * objectAlias: This optional field specifies the file name under which the secret will be mounted. When not specified the file name defaults to objectName.
  * jmesPath: This optional field specifies the specific key-value pairs to extract from a JSON-formatted secret. You can use this field to mount key-value pairs from a properly formatted secret value as individual secrets.
    If you use the jmesPath field,  you must provide the following two sub-fields:
    * path: This required field is the [JMES path](https://jmespath.org/specification.html) to use for retrieval
    * objectAlias: This required field specifies the file name under which the key-value pair secret will be mounted. 
secretObjects: |
  In some cases, you may want to create a Kubernetes Secret to mirror the mounted content. Use the optional secretObjects field to define the desired state of the synced Kubernetes secret objects. The volume mount is required for the Sync With Kubernetes Secrets
