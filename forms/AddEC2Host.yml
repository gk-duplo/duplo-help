Name: Friendly name for host. User provided name will be appended by prefix as "duploservice-<tenant_name>-".
Zone: |
  AWS Availability Zone to create an EC2 instance.
  1. **Automatic:** Select this option to automatically assign the availability zone to EC2 host. DuploCloud will automatically assign a zone with subnet having most available IPv4 addresses.
InstanceType: Select an instance type that meets your computing, memory, networking, or storage needs. Select type as "Other" if you don't see desired option in the dropdown.
InstanceCount: Desired capacity for the autoscaling group. 
minInstanceCount: Minimum Instance Count. Autoscaling group will make sure that total no of instance will always be greater than or equal to min count.
maxInstanceCount: Maximum Instance Count. Autoscaling group will make sure that total no of instance will always be less than or equal to max count.
IsClusterAutoscaled: Check this when you want kubernetes cluster autoscaler to manage this cluster auto scaling.
allocationTags: Allocation tags is the simplest way to constraint containers/pods with hosts/nodes. DuploCloud/Kubernetes Orchestrator will make sure containers will run on the hosts having same allocation tags.
diskSize: EBS volume size in GB. If not specified volume size will be same as defined the AMI.
agentPlatform: |
  Select container orchestration platform.
  1. **Linux Docker/Native:** Select this option if you want to run docker native services which are Linux based.
  2. **Windows Docker/Native:** Select this option if you want to run docker native services which are Windows based.
  3. **EKS Linux:** Select this options if you want to run services on the Kubernetes Cluster.
  4. **None:** This option has to be selected when EC2 instance is not used for running containers.

ImageId: AMI id for the EC2 instance. AMI should be compatible with the agent platform. Select type as "Other" if you don't see desired option in dropdown.
blockEBSOptimization: Set this to enable block EBS optimization.
enableHibernation: Hibernation stops your instance and saves the contents of the instanceâ€™s RAM to the root volume. You cannot enable hibernation after EC2 host is launch. 
metaDataServiceFlag: Select `Disabled` to turn off access to instance metadata. Otherwise you can set `V1 and V2`, or just `V2`. If you do not specify a value, the default is V2 only.
base64: Base64 encoded user data. On Linux machine you can encode script file using command ```cat <filepath> | base64 -w 0 ```.
tags: |
  Tags to be added to ec2 instance. Format for adding tags is as below.
   1. **EKS Linux:** Platform
  ```js
  {
      "key" : "value"
  }
  ```
  2. **Linux Docker/Native:** Platform
  `"key=value, key1=value1"`

volumes: |
  Array of extra block devices in json format as below.
  ```js
  [
      {
          "Name":"/dev/sda1", 
          "VolumeType":"gp2", 
          "Size":"100",
          "DeleteOnTermination": "true"
      }
  ]
  ```
nwInterfaces: |
  Extra network interfaces to be attached to the ec2 host in a JSON format as below.
  ```js
  [
    {
      "NetworkInterfaceId": "eni-095827b411091db43",
      "DeviceIndex": 0
    },
    {
      "NetworkInterfaceId": "eni-0df26c4b283cde675",
      "DeviceIndex": 1
    }
  ] 
  ```
DedicatedHostId: Specify the Dedicated Host ID. This ID is used to launch an instance onto specified host. Example- `h-0c6ab6f38bdcb24f6`.
useSpotInstancesCheck1: Enable to launch hosts using Spot Instances.
maximumSpotPrice: |
  (Optional) If not specified, Default price would be referred.
  If user wants to set, specify price in dollars, example- `0.0245`. Refer Spot Instance pricing [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/pricing/).
